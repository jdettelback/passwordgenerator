# Random Password Generator

### This code generates a strong, secure, random password based on user choices. User first chooses a length between 8-128, then chooses from four(4) character types: lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and special characters. User must choose at least one(1) character type and may choose up to all four(4).  

### There are checks in place to ensure that the password is randomized but includes at least one character from each selected type. This is particularly important if a shorter length password is chosen.
